# TVA Visive Architecture - 8bit computer
This is a repository containing everything related to my [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/8bit) 
inspired 8bit computer build

In this repo you can find the bare-bone assembler I created to program the on-board EEPROM with an
Assembly-like syntax as well as the PlatformIO firmware I used to program said EEPROMS with an
Arduino Mega

# the name
I needed a cool name for the "architecture" and I'm a Marvel fan and thus the connection with Loki.

I asked [Elia Pontiggia](https://github.com/pontig) for advice and he suggested a recursive achronym,
so thank you Elia for the suggestion, I find it mildly amusing tbh

Also "visive" is because there are a lot of LEDs to monitor each and every part of the computer,
I really needed a word that started with V to do the "TVA" thing

# why
because I can and I was bored

here's a couple images
